# GbbConnect

Program to connect inverters (eg: Deya) and program GbbVictronWeb.gbbsoft.pl.

To connect with inverters program uses SolarmanV5 protocol.

To connect with GbbVictronWeb program uses Mqtt server and own protocol (see Doc subdirectory).

GbbConnect remarks:
- Data on disk are grouped using number in column "No". So if you want start new inverter with new data then put new No.
